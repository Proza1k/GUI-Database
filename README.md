### Description:

**GUI Database** - a tool for working with a database in the UI.

### **How does it work?**

There is only one endpoint on the backend, which accepts a QUERY request as input. Query is generated exclusively on the client, which allows you to quickly expand the functionality or connect to any other database.

The list of tables is obtained from the database itself.
